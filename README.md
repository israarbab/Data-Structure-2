# Data Structure 2

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts solving various data structure and bitwise operation problems. These are likely solutions to coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or educational resources focused on algorithms and bit manipulation.

## Files

- **2EqualNumbers.py**: Checks if two numbers are equal using bitwise operations.
- **AllSubStrings.py**: Generates all possible substrings of a given string.
- **DivideWithoutDivide.py**: Performs division without using the division operator.
- **FilpBits.py**: Counts the number of bit flips required to convert one number to another.
- **FirstSetBit.py**: Finds the position of the first set bit in a number.
- **ImplementBitwise.py**: Implements basic bitwise operations.
- **ImplementCircuit.py**: Simulates or implements digital circuit logic.
- **log(n)Power.py**: Computes power of a number in O(log n) time.
- **Longest1's.py**: Finds the longest sequence of consecutive 1's in a binary number.
- **nthBitSetorNot.py**: Checks if the nth bit is set in a number.
- **NumberofBits.py**: Counts the total number of bits in a number.
- **OddEvenBitwise.py**: Determines if a number is odd or even using bitwise operations.
- **OneOddOccurring.py**: Finds the number that occurs an odd number of times in an array.
- **OnesAndZeros.py**: Manipulates or counts 1's and 0's in binary representations.
- **PowerOf2.py**: Checks if a number is a power of 2.
- **PowerOf4.py**: Checks if a number is a power of 4.
- **PowerOf8.py**: Checks if a number is a power of 8.
- **PowerSet.py**: Generates the power set of a given set.
- **ReverseBits-1.py**: Reverses the bits of a number.
- **Swap2Numbers.py**: Swaps two numbers without using a temporary variable.
- **TwoOddOccurring.py**: Finds two numbers that occur an odd number of times in an array.

## How to Run

Each script is a standalone Python file. To run a script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

For example, to run the bit flip counter:

```bash
python FilpBits.py
```

Most scripts take input from the user via `input()` and print the output to the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required as these scripts use built-in Python features.
